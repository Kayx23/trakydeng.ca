A GUI utility built with Python [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) to check if a word is valid as the user spells out. 

The project was inspired by the [nested dictionaries implementation](https://youtu.be/hjUJFjcrbR4) of a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), which I found to be a better implementation than using nodes. I also wanted to play with Python Tkinter at the time, so I built out a small project to couple together both ideas. 

The utility works for both English and French.
