## What eBPF stands for

eBPF stands for **extended Berkeley Packet Filter**. BPF was first introduced to Linux in 1997 in the `tcpdump` utility to capture packets for tracing. It then evolved to extended BPF in 2014, with significant extended functionalities, such changes in BPF instruction set, the addition of [map](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.18/bpf/maps.html), and more.

## Why eBPF

Historically, to make changes or extend Linux kernel's behaviours, one needs to either:

*  propose changes directly to the Linux kernel, which could take quite some while for community to evaluate and accept for a range of factors, such as security; or
* make kernel modules, which can be loaded and unloaded. However, safety is still a concern, because if a kernel module is unsafe, it can negatively impact the entire kernel.

eBPF brings a solution to accelerate the extensibility of kernel and the innovation around it, by running sand-boxed programs in the kernel that can be dynamically loaded and unloaded at run time. In other words, it is a safer and more efficient approach to extend kernel functionalities, without the need to restart existing processes. 

Therefore, eBPF could be used for a variety of applications in:

* Observability
* Tracing
* Networking
* Security

## Example: run eBPF program with BCC

In this example, you will run an eBPF program with BCC to see how eBPF can be used to monitor TCP traffic. The example is fairly simple and you will not need to write any eBPF code yourself. However, this serves a good starting point for additional learning.

[BPF Compiler Collection (BCC)](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) offers an easy approach to write eBPF programs in Python or Lua. While it is not necessarily the recommended approach for production, it is a great way to get hands-on with the topic.

First, [install BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md) on your machine.

BCC comes with many [tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/tree/master/tools) available for use. Here's a diagram for BCC tracing tools:

![BCC-tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/images/bcc_tracing_tools_2019.png?raw=true)
<br>

The tools are installed with `-bpfcc` extensions. For this example, run the [tcpconnect](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/tcpconnect.py) tool:

```shell
tcpconnect-bpfcc    # might need sudo
```

You should see an empty table with the following headers:

```text
PID    COMM         IP SADDR            DADDR            DPORT
```

eBPF programs are event-driven. The `tcpconnect` tool should print one table entry for every active TCP connection, so the next step would be to start some TCP connections.

Open a new terminal and run the following:

```shell
curl httpbin.org/get    # HTTP GET request to httpbin.org
ssh 192.168.3.2         # SSH connection; any random IP ok here
```

In the first terminal where `tcpconnect` is running, you should see two entries:

```shell
PID    COMM         IP SADDR            DADDR            DPORT
11035  curl         4  10.188.0.2       54.83.187.171    80  
11043  ssh          4  10.188.0.2       192.168.3.2      22
```

With this tool, you can look for unexpected connections and improve infrastructure monitoring. See more examples of the tool [here](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/tcpconnect_example.txt).

## Final Words

eBPF is a fairly large and interesting topic for exploration and this blog merely scratches the surface.

I found the book [Learning eBPF](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-ebpf/9781098135119/) by [Liz Rice](https://github.com/lizrice) is exceptionally written accompanied by examples - very easy to follow for a beginner who wants to start programming in eBPF.

The [BCC repository](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) mentioned earlier also includes many tools and examples to play with.

Lastly, on the offensive side, there are also DEF CON talks on eBPF, such has [Evil eBPF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrrxFZfyEsw).

I enjoyed learning about this topic and I hope you do too! Happy exploring.
