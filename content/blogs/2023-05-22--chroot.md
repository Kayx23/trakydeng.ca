## What is `chroot`

[chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) is an operation in unix and unix-like operating systems that allows users to change the root directory of a process and its children to a new location on the filesystem. 

For a quick idea:
```
/
├── bin
├── usr
├── var
├── lib
├── newroot
│   ├── bin
│   ├── lib
│   ├── ...
├── ...
```

When you chroot a process, you are essentially creating a new filesystem environment for that process and its children. Access to files and directories is restricted within the new root directory. The environment created by chroot is sometimes called a **chroot jail**.

## Demo: running `bash` in a chroot jail

The following is a demo of running `bash` in a chroot jail on Debian:

1. Create directories for bash binary and its dependencies:
  ```
  mkdir -p ~/chrootjail/{bin,lib,lib64}
  ```

2. Copy `bash` binary into the new root:
  ```
  cp /bin/bash ~/chrootjail/bin/bash
  ```

3. Check dependencies:
  ```
  ldd /bin/bash
  ```
  You should see results similar to the following:
  ```
  linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd807ec000)
  libtinfo.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6 (0x00007f00c86fa000)
  libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f00c86f4000)
  libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f00c8520000)
  /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f00c8869000)
  ```
  Other than the [vDSO](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html) `linux-vdso.so.1`, the other shared libraries should be copied to the new root.

3. Copy the dependencies into `/chrootjail`:
  ```
  cp --parent \
    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.6 \
    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 \
    /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 \
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 \
    ~/chrootjail
  ```
  The `--parent` option in the `cp` command retains the parent directory structure of the files being copied, when files are being copied to a new location.

4. Start a new session in `/chrootjail`:
  ```
  sudo chroot ~/chrootjail /bin/bash
  ```
  If everything is ok, you should see the bash prompt similar to the following:
  ```
  bash-5.1# 
  ```

## Final words on security

While chroot is a quick approach to create a somewhat isolated filesystem, note that it was **not intended to be used as a security feature**. Chroot was originally designed provide a way to test and debug software in a controlled environment.

For example, chroot is not a complete isolation at the process or network level. A process with root access can easily exit the chroot jail and access resources outside. A process running within a chroot jail may still be able to access network resources outside of the jail, or interact with other processes running on the same system. 

Read about why chroot is not a security feature on [this blog by Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/chroot-security-feature).

For a more isolated and secure environment, virtualization technologies such as containers or VMs may be more appropriate.
