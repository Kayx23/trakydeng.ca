## Overview

Internationalization (I18n) and localization (L10n) in software development are two important concepts that involve designing and developing software products that are, or can be, adapted to different languages, cultures, and regions. 

The term "internationalization" is often abbreviated as "I18n" because there are 18 letters between the "I" and the "n" in the word, while "localization" is abbreviated as "L10n" because there are 10 letters between the "L" and the "n".

While I18n refers to the process of designing software products for global audiences, and L10n refers to the process of adapting software products for specific locales or regions, these concepts are closely related. 

## History 

In the early days of I18n, software developers would often create separate versions of their software for different languages and regions. This was a time-consuming and expensive process that required significant resources.

In the 1980s, the concept of I18n libraries emerged. One of the earliest I18n guideline was the [X/Open Portability Guide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X/Open#X/Open_Portability_Guide), by X/Open group (also known as the Open Group for Unix Systems), which included a section on internationalization and provided guidelines for creating software that could be easily adapted to different languages and regions. It advises against creating different versions of software for different languages by advocating for a modular approach to software design. Specifically, the guide recommends separating the functionality of the software from its user interface, which allows different components of the interface to be easily localized for different languages and regions.


## What I18n Covers

Components of internationalization (I18n) often include, but not limited to:  
* character encoding
* language support
* date and time formatting
* currency and number formatting
* user interface design
* culturally-specific references and norms
* regional regulations

Different organizations / projects have different specifications on what I18n should cover. Here are a few reading resources:

* [GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)
* [i18next JavaScript Internationalization Framework](https://www.i18next.com)
* [Docusaurus i18n](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction)
* [Microsoft Learn - Software Internationalization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/software-internationalization)
* [Google Internationalization (i18n) open source libraries and APIs](https://developers.google.com/international)
* [Apple Developer - Localization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localization)


## Final Words 

To recap, it is important to have i18n support in software built for global audiences. Different software products may have different strategy to I18n based on their specificity.
