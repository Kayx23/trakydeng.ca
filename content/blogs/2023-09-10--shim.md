I ran into an error the other day in a Github action that involves the building of a Docker image:

```text
ERROR: Cannot start service xxxxx: failed
to create task for container: failed to
create shim task: OCI runtime create failed:
runc create failed: unable to start container 
process: exec: "/docker-entrypoint.sh": 
permission denied: unknown
```

While it is easily understood that the issue here is the script `docker-entrypoint.sh` was not made executable, I had no idea what a shim was. A journey of Google searching then started.

## What is a shim

In software engineering, a _shim_ is a general concept that refers to a component which acts as an **intermediary** or **compatibility layer** between two **incompatible** interfaces or components. The term is sometimes used interchangeably with an adapter or a driver, but depending on the specific context, there could be slight technical differences in their meanings. These differences can vary based on the software domain or the specific technologies involved.

Here is a [cartoonized explanation of a shim](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51646150/7741103), where the concept of a shim is demonstrated by the _fairy dog mother_.

## What was the error about

Docker Engine uses [containerd](https://containerd.io) as the container manager for managing the container lifecycle. By default, containerd uses [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) as its container runtime.

The [`failed to create shim task`](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/d015c99b2ec990c914a4b4546ec10d61cd947ab0/runtime/v2/manager.go#L440) error originated from containerd. The **containerd shim** refers to a component in the [containerd](https://containerd.io) that serves as an intermediary between the containerd runtime/manager and the lower-level container runtime used to execute containers, such as [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc). It helps to abstract and manage the interactions between the two counterparts and is required for proper integrations of the two.

See [this blog](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/implementing-container-runtime-shim/) for a fantastic illustration of how a containerd shim fits into the Docker architecture. 

## Additional readings

There's a lot more information and materials around these topics that could be further explored, some of which that helped me were:

* [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org): an open governance structure which has developed specifications of industry standards on container formats and runtimes.
* [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc): a CLI tool, donated by Docker to the OCI, for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specifications.
* [containerd](https://containerd.io): open source container runtime used by Docker. It manages the container lifecycle, such as creating, starting, and stopping containers.
* [alternative Docker container runtimes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/alternative-runtimes/): use any other container runtime that implements the containerd _shim API_.
* [Ivan Velichko's blog](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/implementing-container-runtime-shim/) on Implementing Container Runtime Shim.

Bonne lecture!
