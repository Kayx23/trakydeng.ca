## What is WebAssembly

WebAssembly (also known as WASM) is a low-level [binary format](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/index.html) for executing code. It is not a new language meant to be written by hand, but rather, a **compilation target** for various source languages, such as C, C++, and Rust.

WASM can improve performances of programs as it is executed at near CPU-[native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_(computing)) speed. See [WASM high-level goals](https://webassembly.org/docs/high-level-goals/) for more of its value propositions.

At the time of writing, [WebAssembly 1.0](https://webassembly.github.io/mutable-global/core/intro/introduction.html) has shipped with 4 major browser engines, which enable WASM support in Chrome, Safari, FireFox, and Microsoft Edge. For more details about browser support, see the [roadmap](https://webassembly.org/roadmap/).

## Where does WASM run

WASM code can be run in browser or outside browser in WASM runtimes, as mentioned in a [recent CNCF talk on the WASM landscape](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/09/06/introducing-the-wasm-landscape/):

> Originally created as a secure sandbox to run compiled C/C++ code in web browsers, WebAssembly (Wasm) has been gaining traction and momentum on the server-side.

The VM in browser, which historically only supported JavaScript, now [also supports WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Concepts#how_does_webassembly_fit_into_the_web_platform).

To run WASM code outside of a browser, you can use a standalone WASM runtime, such as [wasmer](https://wasmer.io), [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev), [WAVM](https://github.com/WAVM/WAVM), or [wasmedge](https://wasmedge.org).

See different areas of in-browser and outside-browser [use cases](https://webassembly.org/docs/use-cases/) identified during the design of WebAssembly.

## Example: Compiling a C Program to WASM

In this section, you will be compiling a hello-world C program to WASM and run the code in browser. Use the following sample code:

```C
int main() {
    printf("Hello, WebAssembly!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

For compilation, you can use an online tool called [WasmFiddle](https://wasdk.github.io/WasmFiddle/), without the requirement of any additional installation. Alternatively, you can choose to download and use [Emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten), a popular toolchain to compile C/C++ to WASM.

In WasmFiddle, paste the C sample code into the input box for source code and click on **Build**. You should see the text format of the WASM code generated at the bottom left:

![wasmfiddle-1](/media/wasm/wasmfiddle-1.png)

In the dropdown menu, select **Code Buffer** to convert the WASM code into an array of 8-bit unsigned integers:

![wasmfiddle-1](/media/wasm/wasmfiddle-2.png)

This will be included in the JavaScript code in the next step. Alternatively, you can save the WASM code as a `hello-wasm.wasm` file and adjust the JavaScript code accordingly to load the file into the program.

Create an HTML file `hello-wasm.html` with the following code to run the WASM code and print **Hello, WebAssembly!** in the HTML body:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>WebAssembly Example</title>
</head>

<body>
  <script>

    const wasmCode = new Uint8Array([0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 138, 128, 128, 128, 0, 2, 96, 1, 127, 1, 127, 96, 0, 1, 127, 2, 140, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 3, 101, 110, 118, 4, 112, 117, 116, 115, 0, 0, 3, 130, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 1, 4, 132, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 112, 0, 0, 5, 131, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 0, 1, 6, 129, 128, 128, 128, 0, 0, 7, 145, 128, 128, 128, 0, 2, 6, 109, 101, 109, 111, 114, 121, 2, 0, 4, 109, 97, 105, 110, 0, 1, 10, 143, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 137, 128, 128, 128, 0, 0, 65, 16, 16, 0, 26, 65, 0, 11, 11, 154, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 0, 65, 16, 11, 20, 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 87, 101, 98, 65, 115, 115, 101, 109, 98, 108, 121, 33, 0]);

    const imports = {
      env: {
        puts: (strPtr) => {
          const decoder = new TextDecoder();
          const string = decoder.decode(new Uint8Array(wasmInstance.exports.memory.buffer, strPtr));
          document.body.innerHTML += string;
        }
      }
    };

    const wasmModule = new WebAssembly.Module(wasmCode);
    const wasmInstance = new WebAssembly.Instance(wasmModule, imports);
    wasmInstance.exports.main();

  </script>
</body>

</html>
```

Open the file either by doubling clicking, or by serving it in a development live server. You should see an **Hello, WebAssembly!**:

![hello-wasm.png](/media/wasm/hello-wasm.png)

...et voila!

### View WASM text format in developer tools

You have previously seen the [text format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format) of the WASM code generated with the online tool. You can also find the text format of any WASM code loaded for a web page in the browser developer tool.

In Chrome, you can right-click on anything and click on **Inspect** to open the developer tools. Next, click on **Sources**, and under **wasm**, you should find the loaded wasm modules for selection and inspection:

## Final Words

That's all for this introductory blog. Here are a few additional resources for exploration:

* [WebAssembly High-Level Goals](https://webassembly.org/docs/high-level-goals/)
* [WebAssembly Design Documents](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design)
* [MDN Web Docs on WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)
* [WASI (WebAssembly System Interface)](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI)

I personally found the MDN docs quite comprehensive and easy to understand, compared to the others.

Happy reading & building!
