I was wandering around Codepen for cool animations a while back and spotted an interactive tearable mesh animation:

<div>
<p class="codepen" data-height="500" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="nYQrNP" data-editable="true" data-user="dissimulate" style="height: 500px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid;">
</p>
<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
</div>

Quite therapeutic, innit?! It reminds me of a [rage room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_room) â€“ such a stress reliever.

## Final Words 

To recap, Internationalization (I18n) and Localization (L10n) and two closely related concepts in modern software development. They are important considerations for software products built for global audiences. The specific strategy for I18n and L10n will depend on the needs and requirements of the software product, as well as the target markets and user base.
